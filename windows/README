.NET bindings
=============

The .NET Framework can be installed on computers running Microsoft Windows operating systems. It supports multiple programming languages, including C#, VB.NET, C++/CLI, Pascal, Fortran and includes a large class library for that solves many common programming problems. These bindings have been compiled using the free Visual Studio Community 2015 IDE from Microsoft (https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) and was built against .NET Framework Version 4. The binding consists of a single, mixed-mode assembly XrayLib.NET.dll written in C++/CLI. The assembly provides the interop between a managed XrayLib class and the native functions and types exposed by libxrl-7.dll. This combines the language interoperability of .NET with the performance of the native underlying functions. A pre-built Release version of the assembly and an example program can be found in the bin folder together with a HTML Help v1 file.

To use XrayLib.NET.dll in Visual Studio:

1)     Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer

2)     Click the References... menu item

3)     Click the Add New Reference... button in the dialog box

4)     Click the Browse tab of the Add Reference dialog box

5)     Navigate to the xraylib Lib folder and select the XrayLib.NET.dll file

6)     Click the OK buttons to add the assembly reference and close the dialog boxes

7)     Assuming you are using C#, add the following line to the top of your source code file

using Science;

8)     To create a instance of the XrayLib class that provides access to the XrayLib functionality, use the make the following call

XrayLib xl = XrayLib.Instance;

The class uses the static property Instance to implement a singleton pattern so that only a single instance of the XrayLib class is created and can be used throughout your program.
